# Project CertikOS
A simple OS that runs on qemu emulator. The project was developed as a part of COP 6611 - Operating Systems

**Steps to run the code:**


1. Make sure you have installed the qemu and python2.7

2. Clean the project, compile the program and run the OS
```
$ make clean
$ make 
$ make qemu
```
Wait for a few seconds. As the OS boots, you'll be able to interact with the OS using the inbuilt terminal. Type the 
following command for more information
```
/> startuser
```

Thank you.
